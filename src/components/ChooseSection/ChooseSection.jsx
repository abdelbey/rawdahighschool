                            Despite the difficult circumstances that the country is going through, and their painful repercussions on the educational sector, the kindergarten students, male and female, not only succeeded in passing the official certificate, but also excelled in their percentage of excellence and achieving first places at the level of Lebanon and the North. The kindergarten children’s distinction in the secondary school certificate was the result of their toil, work, and patience with distance learning, and their confidence in themselves and in their school.                             </Card.Text>

                                The school has a diverse student population, and new coming students are required to take entrance exams for the appropriate level. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Rawdat El Fayhaa implemented remote learning for its students and gradually returned to on-site learning after ensuring that all students and staff were vaccinated. The school’s current infection rate is very low.
